{"question_id": 3, "text": "What are the main differences between Python and JavaScript programming languages?", "category": "generic", "model_id": "/root/llm_model/qwen2.5_3B_bistu_sft", "metadata": {}, "answer": "Python and JavaScript are both popular programming languages, but they have some key differences. Python is a high-level, interpreted language that is known for its readability and ease of use. It is often used for web development, data analysis, and scientific computing. JavaScript, on the other hand, is a client-side scripting language that is primarily used for web development. It is known for its ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and create interactive web pages. Python is also used for web development, but it is more commonly used for server-side scripting. Additionally, Python has a larger standard library than JavaScript, which means that it has more built-in functions and modules for common tasks. Finally, Python is a statically typed language, which means that the type of a variable must be declared before it is used, while JavaScript is dynamically typed, which means that the type of a variable can change at runtime."}
