Examples of biometric identities include fingerprints, handprints, palm prints, and thumbprints. In one embodiment, a counter is associated with each specific instance of a biometric feature found in the multiple images. Specific instances of biometric features found most frequently have high counts and are indicative of true identifications; those with low counts are indicative of false identifications. A threshold distinguishes between true and false identifications. Those specific instances with counts below the threshold are excluded when the digital representation of the biometric identity is generated. Thus, the methodology eliminates false identifications of specific instances of biometric features while accentuating true identifications.", "response": "Biometric feature extraction using multiple image instantiations"}
